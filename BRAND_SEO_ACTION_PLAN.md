2. **Title tag structure** - Brand name was not prioritized at the beginning
3. **Competing businesses** - Other "VSK Traders" businesses have stronger brand presence
4. **Lack of brand-specific content** - Website is optimized for services but not the brand name itself

## Changes Made (2026-01-30)
